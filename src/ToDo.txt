To do:

Add chart headsers

- Create container layouts for inputs, tables, HeatMap

- Create AWS service to compute 


-user entered CI with a valence of opposite sign to TE
-user entered TE and LE ion of same sign
-user entered sample (if they did) with valence of same sign as LE
-user approximately meets net neutrality in sample zone?
	-TE effective mobility in TE is indeed lower magnitude than LE effective mobility in TE
		-else “TE is not suitable given choice of LE”
	-LE effective mobility in LE is higher magnitude than LE effective mobility in TE
		-else “LE is not suitable given choice of TE”
	-Sample (if entered) has effective mobility magnitude in TE that is higher magnitude than TE
	AND: 	Sample has lower effective mob magnitude than LE in LE zone.
		-else:  “sample will not focus between the chosen LE and TE zones”


Add check for multivalent
